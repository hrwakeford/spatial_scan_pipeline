***** SPATIAL SCAN PIPELINE *****



This is a nice overview of what this pipeline does...

This pipeline is intended to reduce WFC3/IR grism spatial scan data. It was
trained on HAT-36(?) data for an optimal TRAPPIST analysis. It is -- at present
-- fully automated. You simply feed it all of your files from any given visit
and it doe the rest.
>>> python sketch.py <path_to_ima_files>


Right now this exists as a single module. This won't be permanent -- soon this
will consists of multiple modules -- including (probably) a verbose plotting
wrapper that runs through the pipeline but saves lots of check-in outputs at
each step.
